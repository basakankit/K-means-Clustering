# K-means-Clustering

## Abstract  
This report presents the results of applying the K-Means clustering algorithm to a given dataset for k = 2 and k = 3. The K-Means algorithm is an unsupervised machine learning technique used for partitioning data into k clusters based on feature similarity. The results are visualized using scatter plots for different values of k.

## Methodology  

### K-Means Implementation  
- The K-Means algorithm was applied with k = 2 and k = 3.  
  
### Visualization  
- The resulting clusters were visualized using scatter plots with different colors representing different clusters.

## Results  

### A. Clustering with k = 2  
The dataset was partitioned into two clusters. The figure below shows the data points colored according to their assigned clusters.  

### B. Clustering with k = 3  
The dataset was partitioned into three clusters. The figure below shows the data points colored according to their assigned clusters.

## Conclusion  
The K-Means clustering algorithm successfully grouped the data into clusters for both k = 2 and k = 3. The choice of k significantly affects the cluster distribution.
